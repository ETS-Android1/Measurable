# Measurable

Measurable is an Android application that allows users to measure the height and distance away from objects. 

The application works by getting the height of the user, and using the accelerometer to find the angle from the normal. 
We can then use sin and cos to find the distance to the object, and the height of the object. 

This project was written while I was in highschool. 
A demo of the application can be found here:
